## About
This repo is an archive of the last version of the Tech Career Growth (TCG) Android app that was entirely local. Going forward, the app will become closed source as we make it full-stack and more integral to the startup we're building.

Regardless, feel free to use this repo as a resource to build your own Android apps - As I have mentioned many times before with my side projects, the code here is at the level I would write it at Instagram Android. It's all battle-tested, resilient, and of the highest quality I can offer.

Lastly, you can still use the "Issues" section to file bugs you find with the app. User feedback is still crucial to us as we continue striving to ship the best app possible.
